 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The goal of the Vibrosonics project is to enable those who struggle with or
 * cannot hear to enjoy audio-based entertainment in a different way as well
 * as potentially enhance audio-related experiences for enthusiasts by adding
 * the sensation of touch.
 *
 * @section what_sec What is it?
 *
 * The goal of the project is to create an easily wearable portable device that
 * can take in audio signals and convert them to vibrations reflective of the
 * intensity and pitch of the initial sound.
 *
 * The majority of initial adoption would likely be from users for whom the
 * product directly fills an unmet need. Within the context of this device,
 * this will be clients who require haptic feedback as a replacement for audio.
 * Examples may include those who are deaf or hard of hearing, or employers whose
 * work environments make pure audio based communication difficult and require
 * alternatives. Subsequent adopters are likely to be enthusiasts who will use
 * the product to enhance events or activities they already partake in by adding
 * a tactile aspect, such as in silent raves or virtual and alternate reality gaming.
 *
 * Currently, the market for similar devices is highly limited and undeveloped.
 * This project seeks to expand upon what little exists by incorporating a higher
 * range of translated audio frequencies along with more detailed audio-to-haptic
 * translation into the final tactile experience. Ideally, this product would
 * progressively gain new users by becoming a serious consideration for the
 * aforementioned groups that require an alternative to pure audio. However, this
 * is a relatively niche customer base. The biggest growth in adoption would come
 * from making this product potentially appeal to everyone by adding the element
 * of touch to some forms of digital entertainment.
