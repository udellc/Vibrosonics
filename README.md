# Vibrosonics

## Experience audio through vibration

**Vibrosonics** is an Arduino library that enables you to translate audio into
tactile vibrations in real-time.

## Overview

The goal of the Vibrosonics project is to enable those who struggle with or
cannot hear to enjoy audio-based entertainment in a different way as well as
potentially enhance audio-related experiences for enthusiasts by adding the
sensation of touch.

The aim is to create an easily wearable, portable device that can take in audio
signals and convert them to vibrations in the haptic range. These vibrations
should accurately portray different pitches and intensities of sound.

We have partnered with [Cymaspace](https://www.cymaspace.org/), an organization
whose goal is to make culture and arts accessible for the deaf and hard of
hearing community. This group of people makes up our primary audience, as
haptic feedback can be used to replace or enhance audio. Some secondary users
would be employers whose work environments make pure audio based communication
difficult. They could instead receive important audio cues through haptics.
Lastly, events such as silent raves, or games that use alternate reality could
be interested in using this product to add a new sense. In all these scenarios,
the use of haptic vibrations can be used to enhance user experiences in an
accessible and interactive way.

Currently, Apple has a feature called “music haptics”. Similarly to
Vibrosonics, this provides a way for users to experience music through tactile
vibrations. You can only use this feature with an Apple iPhone with iOS 18 or
higher, and it only works for music. While our product is currently also
focused on music, we hope that this will someday be used in everyday life as
well. Our product is also compatible for use on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
